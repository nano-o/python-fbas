    Try to find two disjoint quorums in the FBAS graph, or prove that they don't exist.

    We create a formula that is satisfiable if and only if there exist two disjoint quorums in the (flattened) FBAS.
    The idea is to create two propositional variables ('A',v) and ('B',v) for each validator v.
    ('A',v) indicates whether v is in a quorum 'A', and ('B',v) indicates whether v is in a quorum 'B'.
    Then we create constraints asserting that 'A' is a non-empty quorum and 'B' is a non-empty quorum.
    Finally we assert that no validator is in both quorums, and we check for satisfiability.
    If the constraints are satisfiable, then we have two disjoint quorums.
    Otherwise, we know that no two disjoint quorums exist.
