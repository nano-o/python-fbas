# python-fbas

python-fbas is a tool to analyze Federated Byzantine Agreement Systems (FBAS), as used in the Stellar network, using automated constraint solvers like SAT solvers.
It can find disjoint quorums, minimal-cardinality splitting sets, minimal-cardinality blocking sets, and minimal-cardinality history-critical sets.

python-fbas seems to be able to handle much larger FBASs than [fbas_analyzer](https://github.com/trudi-group/fbas_analyzer) or the quorum-intersection checker of [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/).

## Technical highlights

We encode the problem of finding disjoint quorums as a SAT instance.
For the other problems, we are after minimal sets with some properties. In this case we encode the problem as a MaxSAT instances.
We use [pysat](https://pysathq.github.io/) to solve the SAT/MaxSAT instances.

Most SAT solvers expect input in conjunctive normal form (CNF), but it is easier to work with full propositional logic (using and, or, implies, not, etc. without restrictions).
pysat implements a transformation from propositional logic to CNF, but our benchmarks showed that it is way too slow for our purposes.
Thus we use our own CNF transformation, which is faster for our use case (see `to_cnf` in [`propositional_logic.py`](./python_fbas/propositional_logic.py)).

When reasoning about a FBAS, we often encounter cardinality constraints that assert that at least k out of n variables must be true.
To encode this efficiently in propositional logic, we use the totalizer encoding provided by pysat.
The paper [Efficient CNF Encoding of Boolean Cardinality Constraints](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a9481bf4ce2b5c20d2e282dd69dcb92bddcc36c9) describes the theory behind it, and it is a nice trick.

## Usage

Optionally create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the package:
```
pip install .
```

Run the tests:
```
pip install pytest
python3 -m pytest
```

Run the main script and obtain the help message:
```
python-fbas
```

To check whether the current Stellar network, according to data from [stellarbeat.io](https://stellarbeat.io), has quorum intersection:
```
python-fbas --fbas=stellarbeat check-intersection
```

To determine the minimal number of nodes that, if corrupted, can split the network:
```
python-fbas --fbas=stellarbeat min-splitting-set
```
To determine the minimal number of nodes that, if corrupted, can halt the network:
```
python-fbas --fbas=stellarbeat min-blocking-set
```

For the `min-splitting-set` and `min-blocking-set` commands, you can group validators by attribute.
For example:
```
python-fbas --fbas=stellarbeat --group-by=homeDomain min-splitting-set
```
This computes the minimal number of home domains that must be corrupted in order to create disjoint quorums.

You might get surprising results due to a single validators having a weird configuration, and you might not care about this problematic validator.
In this case it helps to restrict the analysis to the validators that are reachable from some validator you care about.
For example, to restrict the FBAS to what is reachable from one of SDF's validators:
```
python-fbas --group-by=homeDomain --reachable-from GCGB2S2KGYARPVIA37HYZXVRM2YZUEXA6S33ZU5BUDC6THSB62LZSTYH min-splitting-set
```

A history-critical set is a set of validators such that, together with the validators that currently have history-archive errors, form a quorum; in a worst-case scenario, if this quorum does not publish useable history archives, it would be possible to loose network history.
To find a minimal-cardinality history-critical set:
```
python-fbas --fbas=stellarbeat history-loss
```

Finally, you can also provide a FBAS to check in JSON format:
```
python-fbas --fbas=tests/test_data/random/almost_symmetric_network_13_orgs_delete_prob_factor_1.json check-intersection
```

Note that data form [stellarbeat.io](https://stellarbeat.io) is cached in a local file the first time it is needed.
To update the cache:
```
python-fbas update-stellarbeat-cache
```
